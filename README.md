# Zardo's Event Completer 

This is a python script to automate the process of completing Poketwo's New event quests! The code might be a bit shabby and buggy due to me speedcoding it! Open an issue and I'll see what I can do

## Features
- Fully Automated
- Donates Ingredients
- Crafts recipes and completes orders
- Excellent Error Handling
- Sexy Logger
- Multi-Token Support
## How it works?
1. It sends `@poketwo event inv` to check its inventory for available ingredients.
2. It calculates what to donate. Since butter is the rarest. We priortise it being used in donations rather than orders.
3. It finally donates everything and is done with phase-1 of the app.
4. It proceeds to run `@poketwo ev` to check for available orders.
5. It uses discord-api to communicate with the drop-down and select orders that dont require butter.
6. It finally sends the recipes and crafts dishes.

## Installation

Please follow the following steps to run this app yourself!

1. **Install Python:** Download Python from [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install Libraries:** Download the following listed libraries using ```pip install <library_name>:```
   - discord.py-self
3. **Configuration:**
   - Account Authorization Token in `TOKENS` dict in `main.py`.
   - ChannelId in `TOKENS` dict in `main.py`.
4. **Make sure you dont have any active orders on the bot account, If you do please complete them first!**
4. **Run** the file using `python main.py`.



## Note
This code might have bugs or unattended issues. They are primarily because I've not had the time to test the code to it's full potential. However I'm glad to say that It has definetly shown good results. Any further bugs will be fixed once they're brought to my attention.


## Known issues
1. ~~Failure in Regular Expression while obtaining the dish name.~~
2. Buggy in claiming orders.
3. ~~Buggy in Offering more than 15 amounts of butter.~~
